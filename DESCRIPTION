Description: Plot a PRISMA <http://prisma-statement.org/> flow chart
    describing the identification, screening, eligibility and inclusion or studies in
    systematic reviews. PRISMA is an evidence-based minimum set of items for reporting
    in systematic reviews and meta-analyses. PRISMA focuses on the reporting of reviews
    evaluating randomized trials, but can also be used as a basis for reporting
    systematic reviews of other types of research, particularly evaluations of
    interventions.
