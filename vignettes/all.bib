  Abstract	= {Research publication can both communicate and
		  miscommunicate. Unless research is adequately reported, the
		  time and resources invested in the conduct of research is
		  wasted. Reporting guidelines such as CONSORT, STARD,
		  PRISMA, and ARRIVE aim to improve the quality of research
		  reports, but all are much less adopted and adhered to than
		  they should be. Adequate reports of research should clearly
		  describe which questions were addressed and why, what was
		  done, what was shown, and what the findings mean. However,
		  substantial failures occur in each of these elements. For
		  example, studies of published trial reports showed that the
		  poor description of interventions meant that 40-89\% were
		  non-replicable; comparisons of protocols with publications
		  showed that most studies had at least one primary outcome
		  changed, introduced, or omitted; and investigators of new
		  trials rarely set their findings in the context of a
		  systematic review, and cited a very small and biased
		  selection of previous relevant trials. Although best
		  documented in reports of controlled trials, inadequate
		  reporting occurs in all types of studies-animal and other
		  preclinical studies, diagnostic studies, epidemiological
		  studies, clinical prediction research, surveys, and
		  qualitative studies. In this report, and in the Series more
		  generally, we point to a waste at all stages in medical
		  research. Although a more nuanced understanding of the
		  complex systems involved in the conduct, writing, and
		  publication of research is desirable, some immediate action
		  can be taken to improve the reporting of research. Evidence
		  for some recommendations is clear: change the current
		  system of research rewards and regulations to encourage
		  better and more complete reporting, and fund the
		  development and maintenance of infrastructure to support
		  better reporting, linkage, and archiving of all elements of
		  research. However, the high amount of waste also warrants
		  future investment in the monitoring of and research into
		  reporting of research, and active implementation of the
		  findings to ensure that research reports better address the
		  needs of the range of research users.},

@Article{	  ioannidis_why_2005,
  Abstract	= {Summary There is increasing concern that most current
		  published research findings are false. The probability that
		  a research claim is true may depend on study power and
		  bias, the number of other studies on the same question,
		  and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships
		  among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In
		  this framework, a research finding is less likely to be
		  true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller;
		  when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater
		  number and lesser preselection of tested relationships;
		  where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions,
		  outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater
		  financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more
		  teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of
		  statistical significance. Simulations show that for most
		  study designs and settings, it is more likely for a
		  research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many
		  current scientific fields, claimed research findings may
		  often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias.
		  In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems
		  for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

  Abstract	= {Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are essential to
		  summarise evidence relating to efficacy and safety of
		  healthcare interventions accurately and reliably. The
		  clarity and transparency of these reports, however, are not
		  optimal. Poor reporting of systematic reviews diminishes
		  their value to clinicians, policy makers, and other users.
		  Since the development of the QUOROM (quality of reporting
		  of meta-analysis) statement—a reporting guideline
		  published in 1999—there have been several conceptual,
		  methodological, and practical advances regarding the
		  conduct and reporting of systematic reviews and
		  meta-analyses. Also, reviews of published systematic
		  reviews have found that key information about these studies
		  is often poorly reported. Realising these issues, an
		  international group that included experienced authors and
		  methodologists developed PRISMA (preferred reporting items
		  for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) as an evolution
		  of the original QUOROM guideline for systematic reviews and
		  meta-analyses of evaluations of health care interventions.
		  The PRISMA statement consists of a 27-item checklist and a
		  four-phase flow diagram. The checklist includes items
		  deemed essential for transparent reporting of a systematic
		  review. In this explanation and elaboration document, we
		  explain the meaning and rationale for each checklist item.
		  For each item, we include an example of good reporting and,
		  where possible, references to relevant empirical studies
		  and methodological literature. The PRISMA statement, this
		  document, and the associated website
		  (www.prisma-statement.org/) should be helpful resources to
		  improve reporting of systematic reviews and
		  meta-analyses.},

  Abstract	= {\#\#\#\# Abstract
		  
		  Overwhelming evidence shows the quality of reporting of
		  randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is not optimal. Without
		  transparent reporting, readers cannot judge the reliability
		  and validity of trial findings nor extract information for
		  systematic reviews. Recent methodological analyses indicate
		  that inadequate reporting and design are associated with
		  biased estimates of treatment effects. Such systematic
		  error is seriously damaging to RCTs, which are considered
		  the gold standard for evaluating interventions because of
		  their ability to minimise or avoid bias.
		  
		  A group of scientists and editors developed the CONSORT
		  (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement to
		  improve the quality of reporting of RCTs. It was first
		  published in 1996 and updated in 2001. The statement
		  consists of a checklist and flow diagram that authors can
		  use for reporting an RCT. Many leading medical journals and
		  major international editorial groups have endorsed the
		  CONSORT statement. The statement facilitates critical
		  appraisal and interpretation of RCTs.
		  
		  During the 2001 CONSORT revision, it became clear that
		  explanation and elaboration of the principles underlying
		  the CONSORT statement would help investigators and others
		  to write or appraise trial reports. A CONSORT explanation
		  and elaboration article was published in 2001 alongside the
		  2001 version of the CONSORT statement.
		  
		  After an expert meeting in January 2007, the CONSORT
		  statement has been further revised and is published as the
		  CONSORT 2010 Statement. This update improves the wording
		  and clarity of the previous checklist and incorporates
		  recommendations related to topics that have only recently
		  received recognition, such as selective outcome reporting
		  bias.
		  
		  This explanatory and elaboration document—intended to
		  enhance the use, understanding, and dissemination of the
		  CONSORT statement—has also been extensively revised. It
		  presents the meaning and rationale for each new and updated
		  checklist item providing examples of good reporting and,
		  where possible, references to relevant empirical studies.
		  Several examples of flow diagrams …},
