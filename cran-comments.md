## Comments on this submission:
Thanks for feedback on the submission: Kurt's points have been addressed. I did leave the acronym "PRISMA" in the title (by my interpretation of "Refer to other packages and external software in single quotes, and to book titles (and similar) in double quotes." in Writing R Extensions).

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.3.1
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.3.1

## R CMD check results
